  "description": "Just a bunch of guys with sticks and a bad attitude. The most basic military unit. There isn't really much to say about them, but I'd guess the first warriors were created when one bunch of people decided to take land from another group of people. There may have been more too it than that, but right here is the origin of warefare."
